# xai - Explainable AI
**GOAL** Is to keep up with the explainablity in the field of artificial intelligence. BAsically answering the questions:
* What are the current researches in this field ?
* How can we trust the ML/DL model more ? 
  * Less Black box
  * More Transparent
  
 This will be achieved by following actions
1. Reading the reasearch papers, and writing a summary explaning logical and mathematical arguments /
2. Implementing the ideas into code, to actually see wheather the feasibility of the ideas in coming 5 years i.e 2018-2023.
